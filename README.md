I have finished a Linux CLI, and HTTP part of course and now I can make some conclusions.
I have learned many new basic and the most common commands for Linux CLI.
I have found out more detailed information about HTTP, which has helped me structured my own knowledges
I was surprised by the difference between operating system architectures
Many believe that, by design, Linux is more secure than Windows because of the way it handles user permissions. Its really intesesting.

This was a very useful and challenging module. I learned a lot of useful things.
Principles of a large number of people working on one project.
This knowledge definitely pumped me up
I was amazed by the multitasking and versatility. 
It seems so difficulte at the first time but if you try it out to understand the most basic and useful features everything will become more clear.
I hope I will use all my new knowledges, which will help me optimize my work

## DOM practice

<img width="833" alt="DOM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60383374/117974462-40b2d600-b336-11eb-8eb4-1537e95ec13f.png">
<img width="833" alt="DOM freeCode" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60383374/117974493-490b1100-b336-11eb-9fa0-d48d47dc5bf8.png">
<img width="776" alt="DOM freeCode2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60383374/117974502-4b6d6b00-b336-11eb-96dc-0279099c405d.png">

I studied the structure of the DOM.I learned how to change the content of HTML elements,
how to change the style (CSS) of HTML elements, how to react to HTML DOM events and how to add and remove HTML elements. This is a very useful skill in frontend work, because you can easily take and change the desired element with the help of JS. To modify elements or inspect the DOM tree, we can use the developer tools in the browser.
