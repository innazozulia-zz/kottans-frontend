Git and Github 

I've learned a lot of new Git features:
Branches and commands that help work with them
Commands which help to move between commits
Work with remote repositories

I repeated the most common and basic commands: git add, git commit, git push, etc.
Also I refreshed my knowledge about main principles of version control system

Linux CLI, and HTTP

I have finished a Linux CLI, and HTTP part of course and now I can make some conclusions.
I have learned many new basic and the most common commands for Linux CLI.
I have found out more detailed information about HTTP, which has helped me structured my own knowledges
I was surprised by the difference between operating system architectures
Many believe that, by design, Linux is more secure than Windows because of the way it handles user permissions. Its really intesesting.

VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration

This was a very useful and challenging module. I learned a lot of useful things.

Principles of a large number of people working on one project.
This knowledge definitely pumped me up
I was amazed by the multitasking and versatility. It seems so difficulte at the first time but if you try it out to understand the most basic and useful features everything will become more clear.
I hope I will use all my new knowledges, which will help me optimize my work
